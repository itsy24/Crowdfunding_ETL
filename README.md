# Project: Crowdfunding_ETL
## Overview: 
Crowd funding campaign data cleaned and trasnformed to create a Postgres database.

### Part 1 - 3  - Create a category, subcateogry, campaign, and contacts datframes and CSVs.
Data from the campaign.xlsx and contacts.xlsx files were cleaned and then exported into csv files.

### Part 4 - Create the Crowdfunding Database
After creating the csv files, an entity relationship diagram (ERD) is created using https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/.
With the ERD created, a postgres database is created in pgadmin and the ERD imported to create the tables. 
CSV files were uploaded to the specified table (category.csv to category table).
